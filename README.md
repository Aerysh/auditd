# Security-Enchancement

This repository contains a collection of security rules and configurations designed to enhance the detection and monitoring capabilities of your security infrastructure. The rules are tailored for use with:

Wazuh: A free and open-source security monitoring platform.

Sysmon: A system monitoring tool for Windows and Linux.

auditd: The Linux audit daemon for monitoring system calls and file access.

These rules are aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and are designed to detect common adversarial techniques and behaviors.
